## Coding Challenge

Solution can be found in the [coding/english-numerals-main directory](./coding/english-numerals-main/)

Notes:

- I made an assumption that numbers over 1 million should return `NaN`
- I did not add handling for awkward English as I had already spent a few hours on this challenge, but did add test cases to show some of the possibilities that the function currently allows for
